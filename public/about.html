<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 39-year-old dad from Arizona, proud to be part of a big family and passionate about building meaningful 
  experiences with my loved ones. With a deep-rooted love for exploration and adventure, I enjoy traveling, hiking, 
  and planning fun activities with my kids. Whether it's attending concerts, laughing at live comedy shows, or 
  simply savoring quality time with family, I believe in living life to the fullest.</p>

<p>For over 12 years, I've immersed myself in the world of IT, primarily focusing on data center work. My professional 
  journey has taken me to various challenging and rewarding roles, and I currently serve as a contractor with 
  Microsoft. This experience has honed my technical skills and instilled in me a continuous drive to innovate and learn 
  new technologies, shaping my approach to both work and personal projects.</p>

<p>Now, as I embark on the journey of web development, Iâ€™m excited to showcase my evolving skillset through my first 
  hosted website. This portfolio is not just a display of my technical abilities but also a reflection of my dedication 
  to learning and growing in the digital space. Alongside my career, I balance my life with a diverse range of 
  interests, including podcasts, music, and audiobooks, which keep me inspired and constantly curious about the 
  world.</p>
