Welcome to My Portfolio
This website is a personal project developed as part of a Udemy web development course. Here, you'll find a collection of images, links, and information about my journey into the world of web development. The site is designed as a beginner-level project to showcase my growing skillset, and it reflects my enthusiasm for learning new technologies and creating engaging online experiences.

I'm a 39-year-old dad from Arizona with 12 years of experience in IT, primarily focused on data center work. Currently, I work as a contractor for Microsoft, where I've honed my technical expertise and problem-solving skills. This site is not only a portfolio but also a reflection of my commitment to continuous improvementâ€”balancing professional growth with my personal interests in travel, hiking, live concerts, and comedy shows.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my website. I invite you to navigate through the pages, enjoy the content, and learn more about my journey. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome as I continue to build and refine my skills in web development. Enjoy your visit!
